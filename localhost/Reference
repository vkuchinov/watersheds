URL PARAMETERS
url?type={String0}&mode={Integer1}

String0 could be 'rippling' or 'tidal'
By default, if it's not specified the script
select 'tidal'

Integer1 could be rather 'autonomous' or 'interactive'
By default — 'autonomous'

MAIN PARAMETERS
artefact.main.js

There are basically two timing parameters here — interval
and pause. First one has been calculated by formula and
equals to 8 seconds — the interval for showing information
pop-up. The second variable determines pauses between wishes.

These pauses could be described as 'explosive' motions and,
it's only my subjective feeling, the most sucessfull scenario
and makes everything visually enganging. 

TIDAL SYSTEM
artefact.tidal.system.js


TYPOGRAPHY

You can turn on/off message length [words] by defining
MESSAGE_LIMIT @ artefact.D3Renderer.js

0: turns it off, any other value is number of words allowed 
   the last word would be replaced by ellipsis [...]
   
   Extra tweaking: ellipsis shouldn't have space ahead.
