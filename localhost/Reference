<h2>URL PARAMETERS</h2>
url?type=<i>String0</i>&mode=<i>Integer1</i>

<i>String0</i> could be 'rippling' or 'tidal'
By default, if it's not specified the script
select 'tidal'

<i>Integer1</i> could be rather 'autonomous' or 'interactive'
By default — 'autonomous'


<h2>GLOBAL PARAMETER</h2>
artefact.global.js

Colour palettes and other complex variables

<h2>MAIN PARAMETERS</h2>
artefact.main.js

There are basically two timing parameters here — interval
and pause. First one has been calculated by formula and
equals to 8 seconds — the interval for showing information
pop-up. The second variable determines pauses between wishes.

These pauses could be described as 'explosive' motions and,
it's only my subjective feeling, the most sucessfull scenario
and makes everything visually enganging. 

Some of the most essential parameters you could find at dat.gui
menu, which wold be hidden at final release.

!!!!!!!!!!
You have to click on start checkbox to initialize autonomous/interactive
modes as well as turning on 'full screen'. Without this code runs in
'blank' mode.

<h2>TIDAL SYSTEM</h2>
artefact.tidal.system.js


var NUM_OF_NEIGHBOURS = 7; //this value controls how many neighbours 
                           //would be counted in terms of getting minimal
                           //distance. The optimal range is [3...9]
                           
var REST_DISTANCE = 0.132; //the rest distance, by playing with it you can 
                           //regulate the amount of foamy particles

var PARTICLE_SIZE = 0.05; //virtual particle size, fotms fluid density.
                          //The most desirable range is [0.05..0.08]
                          

var MAX_ANGLE = 0.6;      //wave machine parameters — maximum angle and
var ANG_INC = 0.0038;     //linear rotation speed 

var SCALE_RATIO = 150;    //ideally shoud be set for projection manualy
                          //but for now you can tweak in through dat.gui
                          

<h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>

You can turn on/off message length [words] by defining
MESSAGE_LIMIT @ artefact.D3Renderer.js

0: turns it off, any other value is number of words allowed 
   the last word would be replaced by ellipsis [...]
   
   Extra tweaking: ellipsis shouldn't have space ahead.
