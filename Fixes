[x] colour on the box showing the wish is the category colour instead of blue
[x] box/text need to be a little bigger to read on a projection

    @artefact.D3Renderer HUD_SCALE value, by default set to 1.0

[-] finding on-sreen nodes doesn't work so precise for 'breakng waves' 
    with taking pop-up window off the screen.
    
    Have to use getScreenXY() method for a better result.
    
[-] There is fps lagging, so it's impossible to smooth 'explosive'
    motion as it should be.
    
    However, 'freezed' state lasts for at least 6-8 seconds with FPS
    rate above 60 frames per second, basically in 'idle'.
    
    It can be used to pre-calculate number of forgoing frames (position,
    radius, color) and interpolates these data on exponential scale.
    
    I believe that it would be the effective solution for smoothing motions.
    In both visualisations.
